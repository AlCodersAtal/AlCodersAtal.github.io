        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Coding isn’t just lines of text; it’s a superpower! With it, you can
          create apps, automate tasks, build robots, and even control everyday
          gadgets like lights and cars. In this course, you’ll learn how coding
          shapes the world, discover its creative potential, and get hands-on
          experience coding for Arduino. Let’s transform ideas into reality!

          <strong>Goal:</strong> Understand how coding powers our world.
        </div>
        <h2>Module 1: Why Coding Matters</h2>
        <h3>Topics:</h3>
        <h4>What is Coding?</h4>
        <p>
          Coding is the language of the future, used to create apps, websites,
          and even control hardware. It's what powers the digital tools we use
          every day.
        </p>
        <h4>Impact of Coding in Everyday Life</h4>
        <p>
          Coding is everywhere, from smart homes and healthcare technology to
          AI-powered gadgets. By understanding code, you'll gain insight into
          how these innovations work.
        </p>
        <h4>Coding as a Creative Tool</h4>
        <p>
          Coding isn't just technical—it's creative. Think about innovators like
          Elon Musk and Bill Gates who have used coding to create solutions that
          change the world.

        <h2>Module 2: Tools and Techniques of Coding</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
          <strong>Goal:</strong> Get familiar with coding basics and tools.
        </div>
        <h3>Topics:</h3>
        <h4>Coding Language 101</h4>
        <p>
          Programming languages, like Python, JavaScript, and C++, are the
          foundation of coding. In this course, we'll focus on C++ because it's
          ideal for Arduino projects.
        </p>
        <h4>Programming Platforms and Tools</h4>
        <p>
          Explore coding environments like the Arduino IDE. Learn to install and
          navigate the software you'll use to bring your projects to life.
        </p>
        <h4>Coding Logic</h4>
        <p>
          At the heart of coding are principles like variables, loops,
          conditions, and functions. We'll show you how these concepts can solve
          problems—like solving a treasure hunt with code.

        <h2>Module 3: How to Code for Arduino</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
          <strong>Goal:</strong> Learn how to write, upload, and test Arduino
          code.
        </div>
        <h3>Topics:</h3>
        <h4>What is Arduino?</h4>
        <p>
          Arduino boards are powerful tools for creating interactive electronics
          projects. They're used in real-life applications like automatic doors
          and weather stations.
        </p>
        <h4>Writing Your First Arduino Code</h4>
        <p>
          Arduino programs have two main parts: 'setup()' and 'loop()'. These
          define how your device initializes and runs repeatedly. You'll start
          with a simple LED blink project to learn the basics.
        </p>
        <h4>Sensors and Actuators</h4>
        <p>
          Sensors gather information from the environment while actuators
          perform actions. You'll use both to create a motion-activated light
          demo.
