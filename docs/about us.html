        <h2>Know about ATL</h2>
        <p>
          Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) are dynamic spaces in schools across India
          where students unleash their creativity and dive into hands-on
          innovation. Imagine a lab filled with cutting-edge tools like 3D
          printers, robotics kits, and IoT gadgetsâ€”all designed to turn
          students' wildest ideas into reality. ATL is all about making learning
          fun and empowering young minds to think critically and solve
          real-world problems. With the guidance of industry mentors and the
          thrill of competitions, these labs foster a culture of innovation that
          could shape the future. It's where curiosity meets technology, and the
          next generation of inventors begins their journey.
        </p>
        <h3>What Things can I learn from AlCoders?</h3>
        <p>
          We teach the students how to build and program robots, how to debug
          and rectify errors, create 3D designs and print them, and even connect
          devices through the Internet of Things (IoT). They get hands-on
          experience with coding, electronics, and cutting-edge technologies
          like artificial intelligence, all while solving real-world problems
          through creative projects. These labs emphasize teamwork, ethical
          thinking, and sustainable innovation, helping students not just to
          learn but to think critically and inventively about the future.
